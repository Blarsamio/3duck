      "Patricio came into the company when he was fresh out of his bootcamp, he was always eager to learn and face new challenges. In a matter of months he was already building complex features by himself, no task was big enough, if there was something he wouldn't know how to do, he wouldn't rest until he'd learn how to do it. A clear communicator, great teammate and always had a smile on his face. ",
